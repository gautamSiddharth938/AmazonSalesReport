## Problem Statement

The Amazon Sales Report Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your sales performance on Amazon. This dynamic dashboard allows you to track and analyze key sales metrics, helping you make informed business decisions. 

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a categories.csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Similarly file products.csv also been loaded inot power query editor.
- Step 5 : In products.csv and categories.csv no errors or blanks have been found so loaded to report view.  
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Since the products.csv contains stars, thus in order to represent stars, a calculated column has been added named ratings.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

Ratings = 
IF(products[stars]<2, "Low", 
IF(products[stars]>2 && products[stars]<4, 
"Medium", "High"))

- Step 8 : Similarly a new calculated column has been added to represent Quantity of items sold in last month.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

QuantityItemSoldin = 
IF(products[boughtInLastMonth] < 1000, "Lowest", 
IF(products[boughtInLastMonth] > 1000 && products[boughtInLastMonth] < 10000, "Medium", "Highest"))

- Step 9 : Products.csv file also has columns like isBestSeller, Ratings, QuantityItemSoldin, boughtInLastMonth which can help user to understand the overall quality of goods and helpful in making the decision of whether to buy the product or not.
- Step 10 : A new calculated column been added to show the quality of goods.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written; 

Quality = 
IF(products[isBestSeller] = False && products[boughtInLastMonth] = 0 && products[Ratings] = "Low" && products[QuantityItemSoldin] = "Lowest", "Poor", "Best")

- Step 11 : I also wanted to calculate the Revenue generated by each product so a new calculted column been created using columns like price and boughtInLastMonth.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

Total Amount = 
products[price] * products[boughtInLastMonth]

- Step 12 : To calculte various data through DAX measures I have created a blank measure table.
- Step 13 : In the measure table first measure created was Total price.

Following DAX expression was written to find Total price,

Total Price = SUM(products[price])

- Step 14 : To calculate Total orders following DAX expression was written, 

Total Orders = COUNT(products[category_id])
- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total Revenue.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
 Total Revenue = 
SUMX(
    products, 
    products[price] * products[boughtInLastMonth])
        
        
 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  total Units Sold,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total Units Sold,
 
        Total Units Sold = 
SUM(products[boughtInLastMonth])
  
 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total listed price.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total listed price,
 
        Total Listed Price = 
SUM(products[listPrice])
    
 - Step 18 : New measure was created to calculate profit margin.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find profit margin,
 
        Profit Margin = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Price], 
    [Total Revenue])    

 - Step 19 : New measure was created to calculate Total top rated products.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total top rated products,
 
       Total Top Rated Products = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Units Sold], 
    products[Ratings] = "High")

 - Step 20 : New measure was created to calculate Total Average rated products.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total Average rated products,
 
     Total Average Rated Products = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Units Sold], 
    products[Ratings] = "Medium")


 - Step 21 : New measure was created to calculate Total low rated products.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find Total low rated products,
 
    Total Low Rated Products = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Units Sold], 
    products[Ratings] = "Low")

 - Step 22 : New measure was created to calculate Total rated products.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total Total rated products,
 
    Total Rated Products = 
[Total Top Rated Products] + [Total Average Rated Products] + [Total Low Rated Products]

 - Step 23 : In report view renamed the page to products.

 - Step 24 : After this a new page has been added named Product Details in the report view.

 - Step 25 : In the products page through insert tab
inserted a rectangle from elements and place amazon logo on left side and two blanks also been inserted, in one of them products was written and in another product Details was written on right side of the rectangular box.

 - Step 26 : Both blanks are navigation buttons to navigate from one page to another.

 - Step 27 : A filter logo has been added beside both buttons to remove all filters in the page when clicked.

 - Step 28 : In the left side of the product page slicer been placed of various categories. and on remaining page another slicer been placed of all products in those categories.
 
 - Step 29 : When any category is selected in  categories slicer the product slicer displays all the products that clicked category contained.

 - Step 30 : similarly in the product details page similar rectangular shape with amazon logo on the left side and two blanks as navigation button named products and product Details with filter logo on the right side was displayed.

 - Step 31 : A sliced on the bottom of the page with all products been displayed.

 - Step 32 : Multiple rectangular shape has been used like one for image display of the selected product, one for the name of the product with price and link to the product, similarly one shape was being used to show total stars, next one to show number of reviews, one to show total units sold last month and last one to show total revenue generated by product.
